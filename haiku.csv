five,seven
watching the TV,listening to the rain fall
cancelling our plans,"drinking coffee, eating scones"
sing karaoke,"she texted back, down to clown"
overdrawn account,unnerving strength and wisdom
autumn leaves falling,flip a Canadian coin
boombox blasting tunes,puzzle: Red Vines or Twizzlers
collapsing margin,born on the fourth of July
snow falls quietly,it's marginally better
shoot cans on the fence,watching a Netflix movie
blanketing the world,"building a house of wood, stone"
persnickety horse,making way for the ducklings
computer crashes,a glass eye staring at you
tardy once again,starting at the beginning
melting crucible,chilling on the patio
fire from below,clocking-in to work on time
ornamental tree,"steeping tea, the steam rises"
given to freak-outs,a small stream joins the river
the rain comes softly,going out with all my girls
blitzing your to-dos,sun rising over mountains
cramped quarters in car,I know the secret cheat code
suddenly a breeze,one hand washes the other
the cold depths of space,the dog leaps to get a treat
waves gently breaking,"windy, fruit falls from the trees"
instant pot dinner,a cameo appearance
"whatever man, dang",
the cat sits grooming,
out of space and time,
a dog barks somewhere,
pouring lemonade,
"change the channel, please",
a knuckle sandwich,
open the spreadsheet,
a hare emerges,
the changing seasons,
unwarranted search,
paying the bus fare,
a rocky outcrop,
fantastic dinner,
the blooming crocus,
instantiate class,
the cherry blossoms,
whimsical piping,
the sun shines warmly,
blasting off from Earth,
a trip to the moon,
ice on the river,
meteor shower,
a clumsy puppy,
famous blue raincoat,
